<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, Iâ€™m Arla ðŸ‘‹

I currently work at OSHEE in the IT Billing department, where my role combines technical support, SQL database management, and software development. My day-to-day involves solving technical issues, optimizing queries, and contributing to the development of tools that make billing processes more efficient and reliable.</p>

<p>With a background in Computer Engineering, Iâ€™ve built a strong foundation in programming, databases, and systems, and I enjoy applying those skills to practical challenges in the energy sector. Iâ€™m passionate about finding solutions through technology, whether itâ€™s streamlining workflows, improving data handling, or supporting colleagues with IT-related needs.</p>

<p>Outside of work, Iâ€™m constantly learning and experimenting with new technologies, especially in web development and frontend design, aiming to grow both as a developer and as a problem-solver.</p>
